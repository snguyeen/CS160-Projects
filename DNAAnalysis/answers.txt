Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.43059987061138255

Problem 3:

a) What happened was that I received an error message saying name 'gc_count' is not defined.
That is because I commented out that line used to declare and initialize the variable earlier, creating a bug to the 
program when I try to use that variable later as the program is 'confused' and non deterministic about what 
value to use for that variable to produce the final result.
b) What happened was that I received an error message saying name 'nucleotides' is not defined.
The reason is similar to a). We can see that'nucleotides' used in the for loop later when the variable itself
was never initialized as I commented out the line that assigns value to it (nucleotides = filename_to_string(filename))

Problem 4:
AT-content: 0.5694001293886175

Problem 5:
G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547
Sum of G+C+A+T counts: 26980735

Problem 6: 
Q: In your answers.txt file, state which .fastq file(s) and which quantities differ.  
Write a short paragraph that explains why these differ.
The quantities differ for all files except for the test-small.fastq. Specifically, the Sum of G+C+A+T 
counts is different than Total Count and Length of Nucleotides. That is because in those files (except
test-small), there are letters besides G, C, A, and T (e.g. I saw N in one of the files), making the 
values of total count and length of nucleotieds higher than sum_counts as it only includes 4 types of 
nucleotides (G,C,A,T) and not the other(s).

Examples. sample_1.fastq
Sum of G+C+A+T counts: 26980735
Total count: 27000000
Length of nucleotides: 27000000

Problem 7:
AT/GC Ratio: 1.3223416174746196

Problem 8:
GC CLassification: moderate GC content

Collaboration: Worked on it independently
